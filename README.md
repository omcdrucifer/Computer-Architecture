COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE
=====================
This repositorry contains files for the Computer Science Cert from Codecademy.

The purpose of this repo is to simulate a computer architecture using Python.

I am still in the thinking process of what architecture I want to simulate,
so I will need to update the README after I do some more research.

After reviewing the course material, I see the goal is to emulate a MIPS architecture.
